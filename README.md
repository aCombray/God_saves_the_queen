# God_saves_the_queen
The game is a hybrid of Minesweeper and Chess. The game is played on a 8x8 standard Chess board. 
<br>
You start from the upper-left corner (0,0). The goal is to reach the lower-right corner (7,7) to save the black queenrescue the back queen from the 8 white pawns.
<br>
You, as a player, can move,  recruit chess pieces, and use the pieces you have to capture white pieces. Meanwhile white pieces attack you. 
<br>
At the beginning, you have no chess piece but 6 coins. The white side has 8 white pawns but no other active piece either.  
There are 6 other chess pieces hidden in the rest of the board. 2 rooks, 2 bishops, and 2 knights. They are like mines in the Minesweeper. If you run into them, you will be pushed back, and they became white pieces controlled by the white side. If you mouse click them instead, you spend one coin. If there is a piece you collect the piece and use it later. If there is no piece, you collect nothing but lost a coin.
<br>
The attack of rook/bishop/knight are the same as in the chess game. The pawn can attack the SW/NW/NE. You can choose the piece you have and attack white from your position. The chess pieces can not move by themselves unless either carried by you or attack other pieces.

All the classes are contained in the bin. Need to pack the program to a jar.
